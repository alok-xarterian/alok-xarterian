## 🌈 Who Am I?

Hey, I’m Alok, aka **th3hero**, a full stack developer who’s been building cool stuff on the web for **over 5 years**! I live for turning ideas into sleek, scalable apps using **Node.js**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **PostgreSQL**. Whether it’s crafting APIs that scream performance (think **30% faster** builds) or frontends that handle **100K+ users** with **99.9% uptime**, I’m all about making tech work *magic*.

I’m also a huge open source nerd, sharing **5+ NPM packages** (with **10K+ downloads**!) and tinkering on **10+ Node.js/React projects**. Right now, I’m leading a team at [ViaCation](https://viacation.com), building a travel platform that’s changing the game. When I’m not coding, I’m mentoring devs, hosting workshops, or dreaming up the next big app idea over a cup of coffee. Ready to dive into my world? Let’s go! ✨

## 🎓 My Roots

I earned my **Bachelor of Computer Applications** from J S University (2019–2022), where I built a full-stack e-commerce platform with **Node.js**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**—and graduated with distinction! That’s where my love for coding took off.

## 🛠️ What I Wield

Here’s my tech toolbox, packed with everything I use to build awesome apps:

- **Frontend**: ⚛️ React, 📄 Next.js, 📜 JavaScript, 🛡️ TypeScript  
- **Backend**: 🟢 Node.js, 🦺 NestJS, 🌐 Express.js, 🐘 PHP (Laravel), 🐹 Go, 🐍 Python  
- **APIs**: 🔗 GraphQL, 🌐 RESTful APIs  
- **Databases**: 🗄️ PostgreSQL, 🍃 MongoDB, 🗃️ MySQL, 📚 DocumentDB, 🔗 Prisma, 🔄 Sequelize  
- **DevOps/Cloud**: ☁️ AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS), 🐳 Docker, ⚙️ CI/CD, 📊 GitHub Actions, 🛠️ Bitbucket Pipelines, 📋 Jira  
- **Extras**: 🌍 Hasura, ⛓️ Web3.js, 📈 Agile/Scrum  

It’s like a Swiss Army knife for coding—there’s a tool for every challenge!
